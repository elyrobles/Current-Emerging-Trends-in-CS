# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I created a pirate intelligent agent using the Q-Training Algorithm. I was given code for GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py files, and starter code for the Robles_Elizabeth_ProjectTwo.ipynb file. In this file we were given pseudocode and from that pseudocode I was able to create a training algorithm for the intelligent agent. In this training algorithm, reinforcement learning is used to help the agent reach the treasure by choosing paths and receiving rewards when they reach the treasure. The agent then save this memory for future use and for the neural network. Over time, the pirate intelligent agent will be able to play the game to the best of its ability to reach the treasure.  

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are problem-solvers. They work on developing efficient software that addresses problems people or organizations may have, or, they work to improve software that already exists. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientists, I would appraoch a problem by firstly analyzing the problem and understanding exactly what it is I am trying to solve. I would then create a plan on how to accomplish that, whether that be with flowcharts, pseudocode, or any other planning method I feel necessary to include. I essentially like to follow an agile methodology of planning, designing, testing and implementation to ensure I solve the problem effectively and efficiently. By using this type of methodology, I can take feedback into consideration and make improvements where necessary. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilites to the end user and the organization when creating an AI system are to ensure that the system is safe to use, meaning users should feel safe knowing their information is protected by the system, users should never feel like that technology is working against them because of bias, and it is important to be transparent with users on what kind of data is being used to teach the AI system. For the organization, my ethical responsibilities include creating a system with well-written code that is easily understandable and maintainable by other computer scientists and adheres to the organization's code of ethics.
